# Guitar_Tuner_-_String_finder-

## How To Use :
Step 1 - Clone it
Step 2 - Start a live server

## How it Works :

It might look complex until you figure it out.
It uses pitch, as it may not seems so but there is Physics in the Music, specially when we talk about string instruments.
The tuning, tension in the strings and length, etc. Lets not go beyound whats necessary.
The strings when vibrate they produce sound, and every string produce different sound.
Here we will not talk about amplitude or wave form, But a simple distinguished factor Pitch.
The pitch vary depending on strings, (ignoring other factors).

### String frequencies of standard tuning

String Frequency    Scientific 
                  Pitch Notation
1 (E)	 329.63 Hz	    E4
2 (B)	 246.94 Hz	    B3
3 (G)	 196.00 Hz	    G3
4 (D)	 146.83 Hz	    D3
5 (A)	 110.00 Hz	    A2
6 (E)	  82.41 Hz      E2

As we can see they, I used the standard one for this project.(I'm thing of adding more option in the future)
I used the Pitch Detection Model here, (The link is in js file).
Now the model compares the pitches with the Standard notation, draw out the result.
